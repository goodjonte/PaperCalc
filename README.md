# PaperCalc / Pepper Parrot
This is my first job i did for a company after finishing my study. It is a quoataion system for [Create Design Studio](https://createdesignstudio.co.nz/) which allows them to easily do quotations for clients. The Project is 90% complete, it is currently being used but we are waiting for pricing from suppliers to completey finish the software.

There are 3 diffrent types of quotes which can be done within the software Sra3, Documents, Booklets and Wide Format. Each has its own calculation and stock etc.

For each calcultaion there is a tab for the stock which only admins can access. Where new stock can be created and existing stock can be edited, viewed or deleted.

There is also a settings tab For admins which lets them change any constant values, such as GST and Folding Cost etc. 
Also within the settings flatsizes can be edited, created etc. Flatsizes are the final printing size, they are important as the job multiplier is based off of them. Multiplier is to do with the calculation to make it cheaper per item that the customer buys(For example if someone gets 100 booklets it would cost more per booklet them someone who buys 1000 booklets).

## Running a Job
When a employee wants to run a new quote they would go to the quote tab which is for the right product the client wants printed. 
They would select new job and fill out the client name etc. They would then fill out the printing options and costs related to the quote, paper stock, size, Folds, File Handling Fee etc.
Once everything is filled out the employee clicks generate quote and it brings them to the new job details page where the quote price is displayed.
From here if the job is just a single quote the employee can click genereate pdf to get the quote in a pdf file format.
If the job is not done the empoloyee can select to add a quote from the calculation needed, after that they can then generate the pdf for all quotes assigned to that job.
